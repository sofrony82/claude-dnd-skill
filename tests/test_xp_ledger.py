"""An award that never happened has to be findable.

WHY
===
XP is awarded when the GM remembers to run `xp.py award`. When a fight resolved
and nobody ran it, nothing was written, nothing was raised, and the only way it
surfaced was a player noticing weeks later that their total had not moved — by
which point the encounters that should have fed it are unreconstructable.

The award also left no trace beyond a number on a sheet, so there was nothing to
compare a sheet against. The ledger is that record. `xp.py check` reconciles it.

WHAT THIS IS NOT
================
It does not fill gaps automatically. Doing that needs to know which encounters
happened, and nothing in the campaign format records that yet — `## Active
Combat` is free prose. Inventing a structured encounter id would change the
state format for every existing campaign, which is a decision to take
deliberately rather than as a side effect of a bug fix.
