# Unofficial D&D Claude Dungeon Master
### *with Cinematic Display Companion — Couch Co-op Edition*
> **Ruleset:** D&D 5e — **2014 (SRD 5.1)** by default; **2024 (SRD 5.2)** opt-in per campaign. Choose at `/dm:dnd new` time; legacy campaigns are auto-prompted to migrate (with backup) on first load. See the [Ruleset section](#ruleset) for mechanic differences and dataset details.

> Claude runs the game. You play. The TV shows the story. Your phone is your controller.

An unofficial D&D 5e (2014 ruleset / SRD 5.1) Dungeon Master skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — persistent campaigns, full 5e mechanics, and an optional cinematic display companion that streams typewriter narration, dice rolls, and live character stats to any screen — TV via Chromecast, tablet, phone, or second monitor — while players submit their actions from a phone or tablet.

Built for groups who want a real DM experience without needing one at the table.

## What This Is

You run `/dm:dnd load my-campaign` in Claude Code. Claude becomes your DM — rolling dice, voicing NPCs, tracking HP and XP, and running combat. If you have a TV or tablet nearby, the **cinematic display companion** puts the narration on screen in real time — typewriter effect, atmospheric backgrounds that shift with the scene, a dynamic sky canvas, and a live party stat sidebar. Open it on any device on your network and everyone at the table can follow along. Players submit their actions from their phones; Claude picks them up automatically and runs the next turn.

There are two ways to play, and they serve different needs:

**Improvised campaigns** — Claude generates the world from scratch and auto-creates a committed three-act narrative arc from the setting, factions, and threats it just built. The arc gives the story a defined shape without scripting what happens — beats are defined by consequence ("what changes") not by event, so Claude stays flexible on how each beat lands while committing to the fact that it must. The arc advances across sessions, can be revised when players redirect the story, and continues into a new arc when all six beats resolve. This is Claude as a full creative collaborator: world-builder, improv partner, and story architect in one.

**Structured campaigns** — Use `/dm:dnd import` to drop in a pre-written source (official WotC modules, published third-party campaigns, or a custom DM-written document in PDF, markdown, DOCX, or plain text format). Claude reads and chunks the source, extracts the structure type (linear, hub-and-spoke, or faction-web), and builds all campaign files automatically — acts, chapters, key story beats, telegraph scenes, NPCs, factions, locations, and quest hooks. The campaign runs with enforced deterministic structure: required beats must land in each chapter, Claude telegraphs before delivering them, and steers with world pressure rather than walls when players drift. Drop in the Lost Mine of Phandelver and Claude will run it chapter by chapter with the same twelve DM standards applied to every scene.

**Prepared module packs** — For a published adventure you intend to run more than once, `/dm:module-prep` converts the book *offline* into a **module pack**: markdown the DM reads at the table, maps as images players actually see, a combat-ready bestiary, and pre-generated characters. Deterministic scripts do the extraction — de-columning, page splitting, figure classification — so no agent parses a PDF mid-session, and a validator checks the result before anyone sits down. Packs are module-level, not campaign-level: several tables can run the same pack independently. See [Module Packs](#module-packs--offline-pdf-prep).

**Play in Telegram** — A private-chat bot puts the same DM engine in a messenger, one person running the whole party. It asks who is at the table, builds their sheets from the pack's pregens, and opens the adventure; dice go through `dice.py`, maps arrive as photos, and the whole session is written to disk verbatim. See [Telegram Bot](#telegram-bot).

Both modes share the same DM engine. The [twelve applied behavioral standards](https://github.com/neuralinitiative/claude-dnd-skill/blob/main/SKILL.md#what-makes-a-great-dm--applied-standards) are enforced as hard constraints in every session regardless of which mode you're in — improvised or structured, the DM improvises within situations, lets choices matter, makes every NPC a person, and controls pace deliberately.

It also manages a deep web of campaign data without overloading the LLM — coherent and complete, without burning tokens on context that isn't needed yet:

- **DM instructions** — split across three files with staggered load timing; core rules always in the system prompt, script syntax and command procedures loaded once at session start
- **Campaign data** — NPC roster indexed at load, full entries pulled only when a character becomes relevant; quest hooks and worldbuilding text in cold storage until called for
- **Imported modules** — a published book is kept as a lazily-loaded corpus, not inlined: the act/chapter tree, quest/location bank, and per-chapter source text load on demand, so a long module runs chapter by chapter without sitting whole in context
- **Session history** — archived as continuity summaries, not raw transcripts; full campaign history available for reference without front-loading token weight
- **Compaction resilience** — a compact Live State Flags block in `state.md` anchors faction stances, player cover, and NPC dispositions; re-read at any claim to keep world continuity grounded in source files rather than Claude's increasingly lossy impression of them
- **Autosave** — continuity (state flags, relationship graph, session tail) is checkpointed behind the scenes at scene boundaries and on a turn cadence, so a context compaction never loses your place; toggle with `/dm:dnd autosave on|off`, with an optional Stop hook for a deterministic per-turn backstop

A campaign can run dozens of sessions deep — with coherent recall of past events, NPC attitudes, and long-tail consequences — without the context bloat that forces other implementations to summarize, forget, or reset.

It is not an official Wizards of the Coast product. It uses Claude as the DM engine. It takes the rules seriously and the storytelling even more seriously.

## Using a different LLM?

This skill is built specifically for Claude Code. If you want to run the same framework on a different model — local inference, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — check out [open-tabletop-gm](https://github.com/neuralinitiative/open-tabletop-gm), the model-agnostic version extracted from this repo. It trades some Claude-specific integration depth for broader model support and includes a probe tool for benchmarking narration quality across models.

If you'd rather skip the install entirely and play in a browser, [neuralinitiative.ai](https://neuralinitiative.ai) is the hosted version — same design DNA, sign in with Google, top up an account balance, play. Trades self-hosting (and lower per-session cost) for zero setup and a more refined GUI.

If you're on Claude Code, you're in the right place.

## How It Works

```
Claude Code CLI  ──→  /dm:dnd commands  ──→  campaign files (~/.claude/dnd/)
                                              state.md · world.md · npcs.md
                                              session-log.md · characters/

Display pipeline (autorun mode):
  Players (phone/tablet)  ──→  Companion UI  ──→  Flask SSE server (localhost:5001)
                                                          ↓
                                                   autorun_wait.py
                                                          ↓
                                                   Claude processes turn
                                                          ↓
                                              send.py / push_stats.py  ──→  TV display
```

The Flask server receives narration text, player actions, dice results, and character stats via HTTP POST. It broadcasts everything in real time to connected browsers via Server-Sent Events. The browser renders narration as a typewriter effect over a scene-reactive gradient background with a live character sidebar. In autorun mode Claude polls for player submissions and processes each turn automatically.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- Python 3.10+
- `pip3 install flask flask-cors numpy cryptography` (display companion; numpy required for sound effects, cryptography for LAN TLS)
- `pip3 install pymupdf` (campaign import from PDF — column-aware extraction so multi-column modules segment into chapters correctly; falls back to poppler's `pdftotext` if absent)
- `pip3 install pymupdf` is **required** (not optional) for `/dm:module-prep` — the pack pipeline uses page geometry, font sizes and embedded-image metadata, none of which `pdftotext` exposes
- `pip3 install -r telegram-bot/requirements.txt` (Telegram bot — `python-telegram-bot` and `claude-agent-sdk`; needs the `claude` CLI logged in)

---

## Installation

Install it as a Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add neuralinitiative/claude-dnd-skill
/plugin install dm@neural-initiative
```

Then invoke it as **`/dm:dnd`** (plugin skills are namespaced `plugin:skill` — the `dm` plugin provides the `dnd` skill), or just describe what you want once a campaign is loaded. Update with `/plugin update dm`.

```bash
# Optional — install the display-companion dependencies (one-time).
# Core gameplay works without these; they power the live screen + audio.
pip3 install flask flask-cors numpy cryptography
```

> **Upgrading from a v1 standalone install?** As of v2.0.0 the skill is
> plugin-only — the old `~/.claude/skills/dnd` standalone (`/dnd`) is replaced by
> the plugin (`/dm:dnd`). **Your campaigns and characters are untouched** — they
> live under `~/.claude/dnd/` (or `$DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT`), entirely separate from
> the skill code. Install the plugin above, then run the one-time helper to carry
> over device pairings / TLS certs and retire the old install:
> `python3 <plugin>/skills/dnd/scripts/migrate_v1_to_v2.py`. Full guide:
> **[MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md)**.

## Versioning & updates

The skill tracks releases via a top-level `VERSION` file and per-release notes in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The current version is in `VERSION`; significant changes — new commands, new mechanics, behavior changes — get a CHANGELOG entry.

**To check for updates:**

```bash
/dm:dnd update --check    # shows local vs. remote version + commit diff, no pull
/dm:dnd update            # pulls if you're behind (fast-forward only; refuses on dirty tree)
```

**Plugin installs update through the plugin manager** — run `/plugin update dm` instead. `/dm:dnd update` detects a plugin install and points you there rather than git-pulling under the manager's tracked state.

The `--check` output includes both sides' version strings so you can see at a glance whether you've fallen behind. After updating, restart Claude Code so the new `SKILL.md` and command procedures load.

The skill follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Breaking changes that require campaign-data migration bump MAJOR; new opt-in features bump MINOR; bug fixes bump PATCH. Active campaigns continue to work across MINOR/PATCH bumps without action.

---

## Quick Start

**Improvised campaign** — Claude builds the world and generates a narrative arc:

```
/dm:dnd new my-campaign         # generates world seed, factions, NPCs, dynamic story arc
/dm:dnd character new           # create a character
/dm:dnd load my-campaign        # start a session
```

**Structured campaign** — import a pre-written or published module:

```
/dm:dnd import my-campaign path/to/module.pdf   # extract structure and build campaign files
/dm:dnd load my-campaign                        # start a session — Claude enforces the arc
```

**Prepared module pack** — pre-parse a published adventure offline, once, and
run it as often as you like ([details](#module-packs--offline-pdf-prep)):

```
/dm:module-prep path/to/module.pdf              # probe → extract → slice → assets → validate
/dm:dnd load my-campaign                        # or play it in Telegram, below
```

**Play in Telegram** ([details](#telegram-bot)):

```bash
cd telegram-bot
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env            # add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS
.venv/bin/python bot.py         # then send /start to your bot
```

Once loaded, type naturally — no `/dm:dnd` prefix needed. The DM interprets everything as in-game action.

---

## Narrative Arc System

Both campaign modes use the same six-beat three-act structure tracked in `state.md`. The arc type determines how it's populated and enforced.

### Structural foundations

The dynamic arc draws from several overlapping frameworks in story structure and tabletop adventure design:

- **Three-act structure** — the classical division of setup, confrontation, and resolution, present in dramatic theory from Aristotle through modern screenwriting. The six beats are two per act, giving each phase a complicating turn rather than a flat arc through it.
- **Dan Harmon's Story Circle** — an 8-step story engine (derived from Campbell's Hero's Journey) that emphasizes a character crossing into an unfamiliar situation, finding something, paying a price to take it, and returning changed. The Midpoint Shift and All Is Lost beats are direct reflections of this — the moment the story reveals its actual shape, and the cost the protagonist must pay before they can act on it.
- **Beats as consequences, not events** — the key adaptation for tabletop play. In a scripted story, a beat is a scene ("the hero finds the letter"). In a tabletop arc, a beat is a consequence ("the party realizes the threat was built to outlast any single person"). Dozens of different scenes could deliver the same consequence. This gives the DM genuine flexibility while keeping the story's shape committed.
- **Hub-and-spoke adventure structure** — used by the structured arc type for non-linear published modules. Players approach each spoke location in any order; each spoke has its own chapter beats; the central convergence point doesn't open until all required spokes resolve. This matches how most well-designed published campaigns are actually constructed and lets Claude enforce beats at chapter granularity without forcing a linear path.

### Improvised (type: dynamic)

Generated automatically at `/dm:dnd new` from the world's threat, factions, and Three Truths. Beats are defined by `what_changes` — the narrative consequence that must land — not by a specific event. This gives the DM flexibility on *how* each beat arrives while committing to *that* it must.

| Act | Beat | What it marks |
|-----|------|---------------|
| 1 | Inciting Incident | The threat becomes personal |
| 1 | Complication | The problem is bigger than it first appeared |
| 2 | Midpoint Shift | What the party thought they were doing changes |
| 2 | All Is Lost | A genuine setback — something fails or collapses |
| 3 | Final Confrontation | The decisive moment the campaign turns on |
| 3 | Resolution | What's different about the world and characters after |

Arc beats are tracked at `/dm:dnd end` and marked complete via `/dm:dnd arc advance`. When a major player choice redirects the story, `/dm:dnd arc revise` updates outstanding beats to fit the new direction. When all six beats resolve, `/dm:dnd arc new` generates a new arc from the consequences of the first — same world, new story question.

### Structured (type: structured)

Populated by `/dm:dnd import` from the source material. Acts contain chapter-level key beats, telegraph scenes (setup scenes that naturally constrain choices toward each beat), and branching notes. Claude telegraphs before delivering any required beat, steers with world pressure rather than hard walls when players drift, and marks beats complete as each chapter resolves.

The two arc types are mutually exclusive per campaign and fully compatible with all other systems — combat, XP, NPC attitudes, and display all behave identically regardless of arc type.

## Module Packs — offline PDF prep

`/dm:dnd import` and `/dm:module-prep` both turn a published adventure into
something Claude can run. They differ in **when** the parsing happens and
**what you end up with**.

| | `/dm:dnd import <name> <file>` | `/dm:module-prep <file>` |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | at import time, inside the play session | offline, before anyone sits down |
| Who parses | Claude reads the source in ~4 000-word chunks | deterministic scripts extract; Claude only writes the semantic layer |
| Output scope | **one campaign** | a reusable **module pack**, shared by every campaign that runs it |
| Maps | not extracted | extracted as images **and** keyed text legends |
| Pregens | not built | transcribed from the book, or built to the rules and marked inferred |
| Bestiary / items | folded into campaign files | separate combat-ready references |
| Validation | `corpus_check.py` — layout only | `module_check.py` — layout, load-time budget, page coverage, NPC/map consistency, encoding |
| Provenance | source path in the session log | source SHA-256, per-chapter page ranges, % of pages assigned |
| Re-running the same book | re-parses from scratch | reuses the pack; only campaign state is new |

**Use `/dm:dnd import`** when you want to start playing a document now, once.
**Use `/dm:module-prep`** when the adventure will be run more than once, when it
has maps players should see, or when you want the extraction *checked* rather
than trusted.

Packs live in the data root, never in the repository — they contain the
adventure's text almost verbatim, so the repo ships the pipeline and not the
output:

```
$DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT/modules/<id>/       # default: ~/.claude/dnd/modules/<id>/
```

### The pipeline

Invoking the skill walks these five steps. Each is a real command you can run by
hand, and each writes files the next one reads — so a failed run is resumable,
not restartable.

**1 — Probe before parsing anything.**

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/pdf_probe.py adventure.pdf --out build/probe.json
```

Reports page count, writing-system profile, text-layer density, column verdict,
body font size, **heading candidates**, figures with captions, page furniture,
decorative glyph runs, image-only pages, and warnings. Read it in full — it
decides everything downstream. A sparse text layer means the PDF is a scan and
this pipeline will not help (it does not OCR).

Three independent filters separate a figure from page furniture, because no
single one suffices:

| Filter | Catches |
|---|---|
| Byte-identical across ≥15% of pages | backgrounds, borders, stat-block frames — even re-embedded under a fresh xref per page |
| Below a pixel/byte floor | icons, rules, flat vector frames |
| Placed larger than the page | tiled or clipped background texture |

Headings are found by **font size** (1.15× the body size), not by pattern, so it
works in any language. Spans on one line are joined with word gaps rebuilt from
geometry — PDF writers often express a space as position rather than a space
character, and without that fix headings come back as `Ch1TheDrownedSailors`.

**2 — Extract a page-addressable corpus.**

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/pdf_extract.py adventure.pdf --out build/
```

Writes `build/pages/pNNN.txt` (one file per page, de-columned into reading
order), `build/headings.tsv`, `build/full.txt`, `build/extract.json`. Per-page
rather than one blob, because chapter files are later measured back against
these pages to prove nothing was dropped.

Three cleanup passes run in order, each catching what the previous cannot:

1. **Drop caps by size** (≥3× body, ≤2 glyphs) — judged by size, not alphabet, so
   it catches a Latin `H` opening a Russian chapter and never eats a room code
   like `B1`.
2. **Foreign-script tokens** — whole words in a writing system the document
   does not use.
3. **Rare-script characters** — any writing system under 1% of the document is
   deleted outright. This is the pass that removes an ornament glyph *fused onto
   a real word* (`Caves)` plus a stray mark reads as mostly-Latin and survives
   passes 1 and 2).

Pass `--keep-garbled` to disable all three when diagnosing a bad extraction.

**3 — Plan the chapters and slice them.**

Read `build/headings.tsv`, then write one line per chapter:

front|How to run this adventure|1-5
1.1|Chapter 1. The Monastery|6-15
app-b|Appendix B. Creatures|38-49
```

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/module_build.py \
  --build build/ --pack ~/.claude/dnd/modules/<id>/ \
  --plan plan.txt --title "<Adventure Title>"
```

Writes `source/<id>.md` with a provenance header, `source-index.md`, and
`build-manifest.json`. It prints **coverage** — pages assigned, pages missing,
pages in more than one chapter. Every page should be assigned exactly once;
anything else is a bug in the plan, not an acceptable loss. Front matter and
appendices are chapters too. Split anything over ~12 000 words at a scene break,
since a single giant chapter is the one remaining way a structured campaign
bloats a load.

**4 — Pull the images.**

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/pdf_assets.py adventure.pdf \
  --out ~/.claude/dnd/modules/<id>/ --render-pages 50,51 --dpi 200
```

Reuses the probe's classification wholesale, so the two can never disagree about
what counts as a map. Maps land in `maps/`, illustrations in `art/`, whole
rendered pages in `plates/`, with an `assets.json` manifest. Use
`--render-pages` for the image-only pages the probe flagged — usually character
sheets or handouts, whose content has to be read with vision and transcribed.

**5 — Write the semantic layer, then validate.**

This is the part only a model can do, and the skill states the rules it works
under: invent nothing (anything not in the source is omitted or marked
`> INFERRED:` with its basis), copy names and room codes character-for-character,
cite pages, and verify every number twice. Artifacts are written one per file so
they can be produced in parallel and checked independently.

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/module_check.py --pack ~/.claude/dnd/modules/<id>/
```

Exit 0 clean, 1 problems found. Each check maps to a way a pack fails at the
table:

| Check | Failure it prevents |
|---|---|
| Required files present and non-empty | the DM asks for something that is not there, mid-scene |
| Load-time word budget | every session pays context for what it does not need |
| Every indexed NPC has a full entry | the DM voices a character with no motivation or secret |
| `arc.md` → `source/*.md` resolve | a chapter the arc points at and cannot open |
| Page coverage | adventure text that exists but is unreachable |
| Map image ↔ legend pairing | a map described to players that cannot be shown |
| UTF-8 valid, no `U+FFFD`, no placeholders | `<name>` reaching a player as canon |

### What a pack contains

```

**The load-time contract.** `world.md` + `npcs.md` + `arc.md` are read at every
session start; everything else is read on demand. Their combined budget is
capped at roughly 11 500 words (~17k tokens) — a standing cost for the hub of a
full adventure that still leaves the session almost all of its context. A pack
that violates it — a 20 KB `npcs.md`, a chapter holding half the book — pays
that cost on every session, forever. `module_check.py` enforces it rather than
trusting the prompt.

### Worked example

*Dragons of Stormwreck Isle*, Russian translation, 52 pages, no PDF bookmarks,
two-column, drop caps rendered through a symbol font:

```
pdf_probe    → 213 heading candidates · 5 maps auto-captioned · 3 image-only pages
               29 page-furniture images filtered · 15 pages of glyph noise flagged
pdf_extract  → 52 pages · 23 256 words · one rare script (thai) deleted as noise
module_build → 8 chapters · coverage 52/52 pages, no page in two chapters
pdf_assets   → 5 maps · 18 illustrations · 2 rendered plates (the one pregen sheet
               the book ships, as images)
semantic     → 49 NPCs indexed and detailed · 5 map legends · bestiary · items
               · 5 pregens (1 transcribed from the plates, 4 built to SRD 5.1
               and marked inferred)
module_check → OK, 0 warnings
```

The verification pass over that pack found real errors in otherwise
plausible-looking files: a population count of "three humans" where the source
says two, an invented certainty about where an NPC had gone when the book says
only that another *suspects* it, a Latin `A5` where the source uses a Cyrillic
`А5`, four wrong page citations, and one omitted subsystem. Plausibility is
exactly the failure mode, which is why the check is adversarial and not a
proofread.

### Doing the next adventure

The skill is the reusable artifact — `skills/module-prep/SKILL.md` is the
procedure, `SKILL-scripts.md` the flags and tuning constants. Point it at the
next book and it runs the same five steps. Non-PDF sources (`.md`, `.txt`,
`.docx`) skip steps 1–2 — there is no layout to recover — then continue from the
semantic layer.

## Character Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dm:dnd character new` | Create a character — guided point buy or rolled stats |
| `/dm:dnd character sheet [name]` | Display a character sheet |
| `/dm:dnd level up [name]` | Level up a character — applies class features, HP roll |

### Character Creation

The creation flow walks through:
1. Name, race, class, background
2. **Point buy** (validates against 27-point budget) or **rolled** (3 arrays of 4d6kh3 to choose from)
3. Racial bonuses applied automatically
4. Derived stats calculated via `character.py`
5. Starting equipment assigned by class + background
6. Sheet written to `characters/<name>.md`

---

## Combat System

```
/dm:dnd combat start
```

1. Identifies all combatants, collects DEX mods, HP, AC
2. Auto-rolls initiative for **every combatant** including PCs — results sent to display
3. Tracks HP, conditions, turn order across rounds
4. Resolves NPC/monster attacks inline with full dice math:
   ```
   Goblin attacks: d20(14) + 4 = 18 vs AC 16 — hit! 1d6(3) + 2 = 5 piercing
   ```
5. PC attack/skill/save rolls follow the campaign's roll mode (see [Dice & Roll Handling](#dice--roll-handling)) — under the default `players` mode the DM calls for each PC roll by name and waits; under `auto` it rolls them openly. The DM always resolves NPC/monster rolls.

### Combat Display

During combat the sidebar shows a live turn order with a `▶` pointer:

```
— COMBAT — Round 2
▶ Aldric
  Skeleton
  Mira
```

The pointer advances after each turn. HP bars update in real time when damage is taken. Combat ends with `--turn-clear`.

---

## Dice & Roll Handling

How a player's own d20s (attacks, checks, saves, death saves) get rolled is chosen **at game start** and stored as `roll_mode` in `state.md → ## Session Flags`. Both `/dm:dnd new` and `/dm:dnd load` ask **"Dice rolls?"** so you confirm it each session.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **`players`** (default) | The DM calls for each PC d20 **by name and waits** for the player's result — it never rolls a player's character for them. If a roll doesn't come back (e.g. the physical-dice phone server is down) the DM asks for the number out loud rather than silently auto-rolling. |
| **`auto`** | The DM rolls PC d20s openly with full math shown inline (`Piper — Perception: d20+5 = 18`), no waiting. Good for solo or fast play. |

**Initiative is always DM-rolled** for every combatant (PCs and NPCs) regardless of mode, as are all NPC/monster rolls.

**Per-player override** — a player can flip just their own character via the phone **Settings → Rolls** toggle. That POSTs to `/roll-pref`, and the DM honors a `[[<Char> roll mode: …]]` directive for that character, overriding the campaign default. Precedence: **per-character toggle > campaign `roll_mode`**.

> This replaces the older always-"players roll their own" assumption: the DM no longer falls back to an auto-rolled `[auto]` result for a PC when the dice server is unavailable. Roll handling is now explicit and enforced.

---

## NPC System

```
/dm:dnd npc Osk             # portray an existing NPC or generate a new one
/dm:dnd npc attitude Osk friendly   # shift attitude on the 5-step scale
```

Every NPC gets: role, stat block, demeanor, motivation, secret, and a speech quirk. Attitudes shift on a 5-step scale: `hostile → unfriendly → neutral → friendly → allied`. Changes are logged with reason and date in `npcs.md`.

---

## Resting

```
/dm:dnd rest short    # 1 hour — spend Hit Dice, recharge some features
/dm:dnd rest long     # 8 hours — full HP, half Hit Dice back, all spell slots
```

Long rests advance the in-world clock in `state.md`.

---

## Cinematic Display Companion

An optional local web server (`display/dnd-display-app.py`) that renders DM narration on any screen — TV, tablet, phone, or second monitor. Cast it, mirror it, or open it on any device on your local network.

### Setup

```bash
pip3 install flask flask-cors numpy cryptography
```

### Starting the Display

The display starts automatically when you answer **y** at the `/dm:dnd load` prompt. Or start it manually:

```bash
# Local only (Mac/same machine) — HTTP, no cert setup
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh

# LAN mode — HTTP, accessible to phones/tablets on your network
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh --lan

# LAN mode with TLS — for public or untrusted networks
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/start-display.sh --lan --tls
```

Then open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser. HTTP is the default — no certificate warnings. For LAN devices use the IP URL printed at startup (e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:5001`). Use `--tls` only when the network is public or untrusted.

### Viewing Options

Open the display URL in a browser, then choose how to show it:

| Option | How |
|--------|-----|
| **TV — Cast tab** | Chrome → three-dot menu → Cast → Cast tab; select your Chromecast or smart TV |
| **TV — Screen mirror** | macOS: Control Centre → Screen Mirroring → Apple TV / AirPlay receiver |
| **iPad / tablet** | Start with `--lan`, open `http://<your-ip>:5001` in Safari or Chrome; works in landscape |
| **Second monitor** | Open `http://localhost:5001` in a browser window and drag it to the second display |

### TLS / HTTPS (optional)

HTTP is the default. Use `--tls` only when the network is public or untrusted. When `--tls` is passed to `start-display.sh`:
- A self-signed cert is auto-generated (10-year validity) if `cert.pem` is not already present
- A plain HTTP server starts on `:8080` to serve `cert.pem` for download
- Per-platform install instructions are printed to the terminal (iOS, Android, Mac)

For iOS: open `http://<your-ip>:8080/cert.pem` in Safari → tap Allow → Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → install profile → Certificate Trust Settings → enable full trust.

### Player Input from the Companion UI

![Player input panel — staging an action from a phone](screenshots/screenshot-player-input.png)

Players open the companion in their phone browser. Each device binds to a party character, and the input view shows that player's turn flow as a plain **status strip** so they always know where their turn stands:

```
Your move  →  Sending…  →  Sent to the DM  →  ✓ The DM has your move  →  The DM is narrating…  →  Your move
```

1. **Type and send** — staging is **one tap**. The action sends to the DM immediately (auto-ready) — no separate Stage / Mark Ready step. **Skip** passes the turn without typing.
2. **Sent → received** — the strip flips to *Sent to the DM*, then to a **`✓ The DM has your move`** toast the moment the DM actually picks the action up off the queue (not just when it's staged), then *The DM is narrating…*, then back to *Your move*. This closes the loop so a player can always tell whether their turn is in.

The panel shows a **"Next Turn"** countdown pie clock that loops at the configured autorun interval.

**Device approval defaults to trusting any device on your LAN** — convenient for a casual home network. Set `DND_REQUIRE_APPROVAL=1` to restore the per-device approve/deny gate for public or untrusted networks.

### Player Settings (phone)

Each device has a **Settings** view with controls that tune the experience for that player or the whole table:

| Control | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Text Size** (`A−` / `A+`, click the % to reset) | Scales the reading column via a font-size multiplier (font size, not page zoom) so narration stays legible across the room from a Chromecast. Persists per-browser (`localStorage`), applied anti-FOUC. |
| **Narration** slider (250–2500 words) | Sets the word-count target the DM aims for each turn. POSTs to `/narration-pref`; the next queued action carries a `[[Narration length…]]` directive the DM honors as a hard per-turn budget. Quick "keep turns short" knob for time-pressed tables. |
| **Rolls** toggle (shown when the device is bound to a PC) | Flips that character between *Players* (you roll your own d20s) and *Auto-roll* (the DM rolls them openly), overriding the campaign default for that one character. See [Dice & Roll Handling](#dice--roll-handling). |
| **Sound Effects** toggle | Enables browser-side SFX (see [Sound Effects](#sound-effects)). |

### Autorun Mode

Autorun is the primary way to run sessions with the companion UI. Once enabled, Claude drives the turn loop without requiring the DM to press Enter between each turn.

```
/dm:dnd autorun on          # enable — 60s default countdown
/dm:dnd autorun on 45       # enable with 45-second countdown
/dm:dnd autorun off         # return to manual mode
```

The countdown is configurable per-campaign by setting `autorun_interval: N` in `state.md → ## Session Flags`. To interrupt autorun from the Claude Code CLI, press **Ctrl+C** during the wait.

**N-player threshold** — by default autorun fires when all known players are ready. For multi-device groups you can require only N players:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --autorun-threshold 2  # fire when 2 ready
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --autorun-threshold 0  # reset to player count
```

### DM Help & Tutor Mode

There are two ways to surface hints and warnings on the display — an on-demand button and a per-session automatic mode.

**DM Help button (◈)** — a **◈ DM Help** button sits in the bottom-right corner of the display at all times. Click it and within a few seconds a contextual hint or warning is generated from the current scene and pushed to the display — no CLI command needed, no per-turn token overhead. The button reads the last 8 display blocks and current campaign state, calls Claude in non-interactive mode, and sends the result as a hint block via the normal SSE pipeline. Shows "Thinking…" while in flight; resets automatically when the block arrives. Multiple simultaneous clicks only trigger one execution.

Hint blocks are **collapsed by default** — click or tap the header to expand. Warnings use an amber border:

- **DM Hint** (◈, collapsible) — skills worth attempting, visible options, what each path might cost
- **Warning** (⚠, amber border) — flags irreversible choices before the player commits

![Tutor mode intro hint](screenshots/tutor-hint-intro.png)

Hints can surface contextual NPC and situation knowledge the DM would naturally flag:

![Tutor hint with NPC context](screenshots/tutor-hint-npc.png)

Warnings use an amber border to distinguish high-stakes choices:

![Tutor warning block](screenshots/tutor-warning.png)

**Tutor mode (per-session)** — for new players who want continuous guidance, enable automatic hint blocks after every scene, decision point, and roll — no button needed. Adds ~10–20% token overhead per turn. Use the DM Help button instead for on-demand hints without the ongoing cost.

```
/dm:dnd tutor on    # enable for this session
/dm:dnd tutor off   # disable
```

Tutor mode is session-scoped — does not persist to the next `/dm:dnd load` unless set again.

The two are independent — the ◈ button is always available regardless of whether tutor mode is on.

---

### Scene Detection

The server scans narration text for keywords and crossfades the background gradient and particle type to match the current environment. Scenes change automatically as the story moves.

| Scene | Trigger Keywords | Particles |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Tavern | inn, hearth, ale, tallow, barkeep | embers |
| Dungeon | corridor, torch, portcullis, dank | dust |
| Ocean / Docks | dock, harbour, wave, tide, ship | ripples |
| Forest | tree, canopy, moss, thicket, grove | leaves |
| Crypt | tomb, undead, skeleton, burial | smoke |
| Arcane | ritual, rune, sigil, incantation | sparks |
| Mountain | glacier, frost, blizzard, ridge | snow |
| Cave | stalactite, grotto, echo, drip | mist |
| Night | midnight, moon, constellation | stars |
| City / Town | market, cobble, district, crowd | rain |
| Swamp | swamp, bog, marsh, mire | mist |
| + 6 more | mine, castle, ruins, desert, fire, temple | — |

Scene transitions crossfade over ~2.5 seconds. The server maintains a 20-chunk rolling window for detection so scenes don't flicker on single keyword matches.

### Dynamic Sky Canvas

A canvas layer rendered above the scene background shows a live sky that reacts to `world_time` data pushed via `push_stats.py`:

- **Time of day** — sun arcs from dawn (lower-left) through midday (top-center) to dusk (lower-right); switches to crescent moon + twinkling stars at night; twilight shows an orange horizon
- **Weather** — calm: 2 light clouds; overcast: 5 heavy dark clouds, dimmed sun; rainy: dense cloud cover, muted palette; stormy: near-black sky; clear night: full star field
- **Clouds** — 5 cloud objects each built from 8 overlapping circles; drift slowly and wrap

Push world time data after loading a campaign and after any rest or time advance:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --world-time \
  '{"date":"7 Deepmonth 1312 CR","day_name":"Starday","time":"morning","season":"Deep Winter","weather":"overcast"}'
```

Valid `time` values: `dawn`, `morning`, `midday`, `afternoon`, `evening`, `dusk`, `night`
Valid `weather` values: `calm`, `clear`, `overcast`, `rainy`, `stormy`

### Sound Effects

Narration text is scanned server-side for 12 SFX trigger categories. When a match is found, the browser fetches a synthesized WAV file and plays it via Web Audio API — no server audio output, works on any device with the tab open.

```
impact · sword · arrow · shout · thud · magic · coins · door · low_hum · fire · breath
```

SFX synthesis uses numpy — if numpy is not installed the feature degrades silently. Enable via the **Sound Effects** toggle in the top-right of the display.

| Narration text | SFX |
|----------------|-----|
| "...strikes the shield..." | impact |
| "...draws her blade..." | sword |
| "...looses an arrow..." | arrow |
| "...he roars across the dock..." | shout |
| "...collapses to the floor..." | thud |
| "...arcane energy crackles..." | magic |
| "...coins spill across the table..." | coins |
| "...the door creaks open..." | door |
| "...the altar hums with energy..." | low_hum |
| "...the torch flares..." | fire |
| "...a sharp exhale..." | breath |

The browser caches each WAV after first fetch. SFX trigger naturally alongside the typewriter animation since both are driven by the same narration chunks.

### Live Character Sidebar

![NPC dialogue block and character sidebar with faction panel](screenshots/screenshot-npc-dialogue.png)

A fixed left sidebar shows live stats for all party members, updated automatically as play progresses.

```bash
# Push full stats on campaign load (clears stale characters from previous campaigns)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --replace-players --json '{
  "players": [{
    "name": "Aldric", "race": "Human", "class": "Fighter", "level": 2,
    "hp": {"current": 14, "max": 18}, "xp": {"current": 220, "next": 300},
    "ac": 17, "initiative": "+1", "speed": 30,
    "hit_dice": {"remaining": 2, "max": 2, "die": "d10"},
    "ability_scores": {
      "str": {"score": 16, "mod": "+3"}, "dex": {"score": 12, "mod": "+1"},
      "con": {"score": 15, "mod": "+2"}, "int": {"score": 10, "mod": "+0"},
      "wis": {"score": 11, "mod": "+0"}, "cha": {"score": 13, "mod": "+1"}
    }
  }]
}'

# Partial updates during play
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --player Aldric --hp 10 18
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --player Aldric --xp 270 300
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --player Aldric --conditions-add "Poisoned"
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --player Aldric --slot-use 2

# Or bundle stat changes directly with a narration send (no separate push_stats.py call needed):
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/send.py \
  --stat-hp "Aldric:10:18" \
  --stat-condition-add "Aldric:Poisoned" \
  --stat-slot-use "Aldric:1" << 'EOF'
The goblin's blade catches Aldric across the ribs...
EOF

# Combat turn order
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py \
  --turn-order '{"order":["Aldric","Skeleton","Mira"],"current":"Aldric","round":1}'

# Advance turn pointer
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --turn-current "Skeleton"

# Combat ended
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --turn-clear

# World time clock
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --world-time \
  '{"date":"7 Deepmonth 1312 CR","day_name":"Starday","time":"morning","season":"Deep Winter","weather":"overcast"}'
```

![Character sidebar card](screenshots/sidebar-card.png)

### Clickable Character Sheet

Click or tap any character card in the sidebar to open a full character sheet modal — attacks, features, and inventory at a glance. Works on desktop and on phones/tablets connected via LAN.

![Character sheet modal](screenshots/character-sheet-modal.png)

Include the `sheet` field when pushing stats on `/dm:dnd load` to populate the full sheet:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/display/push_stats.py --replace-players --json '{
  "players": [{
    "name": "Aldric",
    ...
    "sheet": {
      "attacks": [
        {"name": "Longsword", "bonus": "+5", "damage": "1d8+3", "type": "Slashing", "notes": "Versatile (1d10)"}
      ],
      "features": [
        {"name": "Second Wind", "text": "Bonus action: regain 1d10+level HP. Short/long rest recharge."}
      ],
      "inventory": ["Longsword", "Chain Mail", "Shield", "Explorer'\''s Pack", "15 gp"]
    }
  }]
}'
```

If `sheet` is omitted, the modal still opens but shows only the stats visible in the sidebar. Close with **Esc**, clicking outside the panel, or the ✕ button.

Clicking a spell or feature name inside the sheet opens a description modal sourced from the bundled SRD dataset. Scaling progressions (e.g. Sneak Attack damage) automatically collapse to the character's current level. If a spell or feature isn't in the core SRD dataset, a link to the relevant page on D&D 5e Wiki is shown instead. To extend the local dataset with non-SRD content from a character file:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/build_supplemental.py --character ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters/<charname>.md
```

This fetches descriptions from dnd5e.wikidot.com for any missing entries and writes them to `data/dnd5e_supplemental.json`. Run it once after creating or importing a character. A pre-built supplemental covering Circle of Spores, Thief archetype features, and several Xanathar's spells ships with the skill.

The sidebar:
- Shows compact dual-column cards for parties of 2+ (full ability grid for solo play)
- HP bars shift green → yellow → red as HP drops
- XP bar fills toward next level
- Active conditions displayed per character
- Spell slot pips track remaining charges
- Fades in automatically on first stats push
- Persists across Flask restarts (`stats.json`)
- Cleared automatically on `/dm:dnd new` (fresh campaign)

### Replay Buffer

The server buffers the last 60 text chunks to disk (`text_log.json`). Reconnecting browsers (Chromecast drop, tab refresh) replay the full session history automatically — no narration is lost.

---

## Telegram Bot

A private-chat front end for the same DM engine, in `telegram-bot/`. One person
plays the whole party — which is what a starter module suggests for a small
table — and the DM runs from a [prepared module pack](#module-packs--offline-pdf-prep),
so the agent never parses a PDF during play.

```
Telegram ──▶ bot.py ──▶ ClaudeSDKClient (one long-lived agent per chat)
                         ├─ system prompt: DM standards + pack layout (prompts.py)
                         ├─ tools: Read / Write / Edit / Glob / Grep / Bash,
                         │         every call gated by an allowlist (dm_engine.py)
                         ├─ reads:  ~/.claude/dnd/modules/<id>/       (pack, read-only)
                         └─ writes: ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/tg-<chat_id>/
```

The agent keeps its conversation across turns, so continuity costs nothing. What
must survive a restart lives in files, not in the conversation.

### Setup

```bash
cd telegram-bot
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
```

The token is resolved in this order, first hit wins: `$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, then
`telegram-bot/.env`, then `<repo>/.telegram_apikey` (the bare token on one
line). All three are gitignored. Importing `config.py` never requires a token —
resolution is lazy, so tests and tooling do not need a live secret.

You also need the `claude` CLI installed and logged in; the SDK drives it, and
billing follows your Claude subscription.

Verify the pack before starting:

```bash
python3 skills/module-prep/scripts/module_check.py --pack ~/.claude/dnd/modules/stormwreck-isle
```

**Set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`.** Empty means anyone who finds the bot plays on
your Claude quota. Put your numeric Telegram id there (ask
[@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)); comma-separate several.

### Run

```bash
.venv/bin/python bot.py                              # foreground
nohup .venv/bin/python bot.py >> bot.log 2>&1 &      # background
```

Then open the bot in Telegram and send `/start`.

A **single-instance lock** (`$TMPDIR/dnd-telegram-bot.lock`) refuses a second
start with the pid of the first. This is not a nicety: Telegram allows exactly
one `getUpdates` consumer per token, and a second one does not queue — it kills
the first with a `Conflict` and leaves a process alive but deaf, which looks
identical to a working bot.

### Playing

`/start` asks how many characters you want (1–5), then walks you through picking
each from the pack's pregenerated characters and naming them. It builds their
sheets, seeds the campaign, and opens the adventure. If a campaign already
exists it offers **Continue** or **Start over** instead.

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `/start` | begin, or resume an existing campaign |
| `/party` | who is in the party |
| `/sheet [name]` | character sheet, read from the files rather than from memory |
| `/map [n]` | show a map — the current one, or map `n` |
| `/recap` | where you are and what is going on |
| `/save` | flush state, sheets and the session journal to disk |
| `/reset` | wipe the campaign and start over |
| `/help` | the list above |

Everything else you type is your turn — written freely for the whole party
("we head for the temple, Darin examines the statue") or in character.

Dice are rolled by `scripts/dice.py` and never imagined by the model; the
arithmetic is shown. Maps arrive as photos the first time you reach a location
— the DM emits a `[[map:N]]` marker, the bot strips it, sends the image, and
**remembers it was sent** so a re-emitted marker is not a duplicate. An explicit
`/map N` always sends.

### Where everything is written

Three separate records, because they answer different questions:

| File | What it holds | When written |
|---|---|---|
| `<campaign>/raw-log.md` | **verbatim transcript** — every player line (commands included), every DM reply, every map sent | append-only, automatically, every turn |
| `<campaign>/session-log.md` | the DM's own narrative journal — what happened, what it cost, what is open | on `/save` |
| `<campaign>/state.md` | current scene, party, quests, world state | rewritten at scene boundaries and on `/save` |
| `<campaign>/characters/*.md` | HP, slots, inventory, XP, level | as they change |
| `<campaign>/party.json` | who is at the table, which pregens, which module | at party creation |
| wherever you redirect stdout | process log: startup, session connects, tool denials, tracebacks | continuously |

`raw-log.md` uses the same `> Speaker:` format a person gets by copying a
Telegram chat, so a hand-saved export and the bot's own log are the same
document and append cleanly to each other. Transcript failures never interrupt
play — a game that stops because its logger could not write is worse than a game
with a gap in its log.

The distinction that matters: **`state.md` is overwritten as the game moves on,
so it is not history.** `raw-log.md` is the history.

```
~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/tg-<chat_id>/
├── party.json
├── state.md
├── session-log.md
├── raw-log.md            ← verbatim, append-only
└── characters/*.md
```

Delete the directory (or `/reset`) to start over. The module pack is untouched
by play, so several chats run the same adventure independently.

### Security

The bot takes input from the open internet and hands it to an agent that can run
shell commands, so tool use is gated by an **explicit allowlist**
(`dm_engine.py`) rather than run in a bypass mode:

- **Read / Glob / Grep** — only inside the campaign directory, the module pack, and the skill
- **Write / Edit** — only inside the campaign directory; the pack is read-only
- **Bash** — only `python3 <skill>/scripts/<allowed>.py …`, matched by *resolved*
  absolute path, with shell metacharacters (`;` `|` `&` backtick `$`) refused
  outright so the allowlist cannot be walked around by chaining
- everything else is denied with a reason the agent can read and route around

One non-obvious trap, worth knowing if you modify this: **`allowed_tools` must
stay empty.** Naming a tool there pre-approves it, and the SDK then skips
`can_use_tool` entirely — the allowlist stays in the source, looking present,
while never running. The only symptom is a `CanUseToolShadowedWarning` on
stderr. `tools=[…]` bounds the surface; `allowed_tools=[]` keeps the gate live.
A regression test asserts both.

Even so: run it as a normal user, keep `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` set, and do not
expose the host.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | — | required |
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | *(empty — open to all)* | comma-separated user ids |
| `DND_MODULE` | `stormwreck-isle` | which pack under `modules/` to run |
| `DND_MODEL` | `claude-opus-5` | `claude-sonnet-5` is faster and cheaper |
| `DND_EFFORT` | `medium` | `low` · `medium` · `high` |
| `DND_MAX_TURNS` | `40` | agent turns per player message |
| `DND_CAMPAIGN_ROOT` | `~/.claude/dnd` | data root for packs and campaigns |

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| *"Пак модуля не готов"* | pack incomplete — run `module_check.py` |
| `CLINotFoundError` | the `claude` CLI is not on `PATH` for this process |
| `Another bot instance is already running` | the lock did its job; `kill` the pid it names |
| `Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates` in an older log | two pollers on one token — the surviving process is deaf, restart it |
| Turns are slow | Opus writing long prose and reading chapter files; try `DND_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5` and/or `DND_EFFORT=low` |
| The DM forgot something | it is in the files, not the conversation — ask it to re-read `state.md`, or `/save` more often |

## Scripts Reference

All scripts live in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`.

### `dice.py` — All dice rolls

```bash
python3 scripts/dice.py d20+5
python3 scripts/dice.py 2d6+3
python3 scripts/dice.py d20 adv          # advantage
python3 scripts/dice.py d20+3 dis        # disadvantage + modifier
python3 scripts/dice.py 4d6kh3          # keep highest 3 (ability score roll)
python3 scripts/dice.py d20 --silent    # integer only (for hidden rolls)
```

Flags nat 20 (`CRITICAL HIT`) and nat 1 (`FUMBLE`) automatically.

### `ability-scores.py` — Character creation

```bash
python3 scripts/ability-scores.py roll                          # 3 arrays to choose from
python3 scripts/ability-scores.py pointbuy                     # print cost table
python3 scripts/ability-scores.py pointbuy --check STR=15 DEX=10 CON=15 INT=8 WIS=11 CHA=12
python3 scripts/ability-scores.py modifiers STR=15 DEX=10 CON=15 INT=8 WIS=11 CHA=12
```

### `combat.py` — Initiative and attack resolution

```bash
# Roll initiative for all combatants and print tracker
python3 scripts/combat.py init '[
  {"name":"Aldric","dex_mod":1,"hp":18,"ac":17,"type":"pc"},
  {"name":"Skeleton","dex_mod":2,"hp":13,"ac":13,"type":"npc"}
]'

# Reprint tracker from saved state
python3 scripts/combat.py tracker '<state_json>' <round_num>

# Resolve a single attack
python3 scripts/combat.py attack --atk 5 --ac 13 --dmg 1d8+3
```

`init` outputs a `STATE_JSON:` line — save this to `state.md` under `## Active Combat` for persistence between turns.

### `build_supplemental.py` — Extend the SRD dataset with non-SRD content

Run after creating or importing a character to fetch descriptions for spells and features not in the core SRD:

```bash
# Scan a character file and fetch anything missing
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --character ~/.claude/dnd/campaigns/<name>/characters/<charname>.md

# Scan all characters in a campaign at once
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --campaign <campaign-name>

# Add a specific entry by name
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --add "Toll the Dead" spell
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --add "Halo of Spores" feature

# See what's currently cached
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --list

# Preview what would be fetched without writing
python3 scripts/build_supplemental.py --campaign <name> --dry-run
```

Fetches from `dnd5e.wikidot.com` with a polite request delay. Uses Python stdlib only — no extra dependencies. Writes to `data/dnd5e_supplemental.json`, which `lookup.py` merges at load time.

---

### `character.py` — Stat derivation and levelling

```bash
# Full stat block from raw scores
python3 scripts/character.py calc --class fighter --level 2 \
    STR=16 DEX=12 CON=15 INT=10 WIS=11 CHA=13 \
    --proficient STR CON Athletics Intimidation Perception Survival

# Level-up
python3 scripts/character.py levelup --class fighter --from 2 --hp-roll 8 --con-mod 2

# XP tracking
python3 scripts/character.py xp --level 2 --gained 150
```

Telegram-run campaigns live beside these as `campaigns/tg-<chat_id>/`. They hold
only mutable state — the pack they run is read in place, so it is never copied
per chat.

## DM Philosophy

The skill is designed around a set of hard constraints, not aspirational notes:

- **Improvise over script** — the world is a sandbox; player choices always find a "yes, and..."
- **Consequences are real** — NPCs remember conversations; factions shift; failure is possible
- **Economy of description** — two sharp sensory details beat a paragraph of exposition
- **Every NPC is a person** — even minor characters get a verbal tic, a contradiction, a goal
- **Hidden rolls stay hidden** — Perception, Insight, and Stealth roll silently; only the outcome is narrated (but results always appear on the display)
- **The arc bends, never breaks** — when players redirect the story, beats revise to fit the new direction; the committed shape is a guide, not a cage
- **Calibrates to this specific player across sessions** — DM Style Notes accumulate table-specific patterns from calibration feedback; what lands for this party, what splits the table, what to lean into; read at every session load and updated at every end
- **The world moves between sessions** — factions act while the party is occupied; NPCs pursue their own goals; doors that were kicked in stay broken; the player arrives to a world with weight, not a scene that was paused waiting for them

---

## Ruleset

Each campaign declares its ruleset on the `state.md` header line: `**Ruleset:** 2014` (SRD 5.1) or `**Ruleset:** 2024` (SRD 5.2). `/dm:dnd new` asks for the ruleset at creation time; `/dm:dnd load` reads the field on every session. Legacy campaigns (predating the field) default to **2014** and are offered a one-time migration with a timestamped backup.

### 2014 dataset (default)

`data/dnd5e_srd.json` — built from `5e-bits/5e-database` (`main` branch, 2014 SRD) and `foundryvtt/dnd5e` (`master` branch). 1,453 records: 319 spells, 237 equipment, 362 magic items, 15 conditions, 334 monsters, 186 features.

### 2024 dataset (opt-in)

`data/dnd5e_srd_2024.json` — built from `5e-bits/5e-database` (`src/2024/en/`), `foundryvtt/dnd5e` (`packs/_source/spells24/`, `packs/_source/actors24/`, `packs/_source/classfeatures24/`). All foundry content is CC-BY-4.0, with `_source` and `_license` provenance preserved on every record. Approximately 1,420+ records: 341 native 2024 spells, 376 native 2024 monsters, 8 weapon mastery properties, 9 species, 24 subspecies, 17 origin/general/fighting-style feats, 4 backgrounds, plus equipment / magic items / features. Build with `python3 scripts/build_srd.py --ruleset 2024` (one-time, ~3 min).

### Mechanic differences applied at the table

| Mechanic | 2014 | 2024 |
|---|---|---|
| Subclass timing | varies by class (1/2/3) | level 3 universally |
| ASI source | race | background |
| Origin feat | n/a | granted at level 1 by background |
| Weapon mastery | n/a | 8 properties (Vex, Topple, Sap, Cleave, Graze, Nick, Push, Slow) |
| Exhaustion | 6-level table with varied effects | 1 stack = -2 to all d20 rolls (cumulative); death at level 6 |
| Stealth disadvantage on heavy armor | yes | yes (unchanged) |
| Healing word range | 60 ft | 60 ft (unchanged) |

Combat resolution, dice rolling, initiative, AC/HP derivation, XP tables, cantrip damage scaling, and rest recovery are identical between editions and require no per-ruleset branching in the engine.

### Backwards compatibility

Existing campaigns continue to load unchanged. The first time a legacy campaign is loaded under the new code path, `migrate_ruleset.py` detects the missing `**Ruleset:**` field and prompts the DM. The migrator:

- Backs up `state.md` to `state.md.backup-pre-ruleset-<timestamp>` before any write
- Injects the chosen ruleset into the header line
- Is idempotent — re-running on a migrated campaign is a clean no-op
- Has a `--check` mode for non-mutating detection (used by `/dm:dnd load`)

Character files inherit ruleset from their campaign at runtime via `paths.campaign_ruleset()`; no per-character migration is required. The display companion auto-detects the campaign's ruleset and surfaces it as a small badge in the world-clock cluster.

If you want to switch a legacy campaign to 2024, run the migrator manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/migrate_ruleset.py <campaign-name> --ruleset 2024 --yes
```

Note: switching an in-progress 2014 campaign to 2024 mid-arc is not recommended — character builds (origin feats, background ASIs, weapon mastery for martial classes) were locked in under 2014 rules. The migrator simply stamps the field; rebuilding characters under 2024 is a separate manual exercise.
